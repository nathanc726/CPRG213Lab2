        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound mixed mushrooms, Baby Bella and Chanterelle, cleaned, bottom trimmed and quartered</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cup heavy cream</li>

        <ol>

                to 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, add the lemon juice, butter, and mushrooms. Cover and cook over medium heat until the
                mushrooms are tender, 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
